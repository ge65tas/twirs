#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! Rust port of the [astrometric plate solving package twirl](https://github.com/lgrcia/twirl). \
//! Currently, no source detection or catalog query is included. This only calculates the transformation
//! between a set of detected sources and a provided catalog. To that end, asterisms of three or four stars
//! are built, hashed, and then matched. \
//! Since it is faithful to the original, most documentation on the chosen algorithm applies.
//!
//! ## Interface
//! The central struct of this library is [`Twirs`]. It is used to choose the asterism scheme,
//! specify the sets of points and matching parameters, and find the plate solutions. \
//! In most cases, it should be created with [`Twirs::triangles()`] or [`Twirs::quads()`],
//! but for generic contexts, the asterism can be specified in [`Twirs::new()`].
//! In any case, additional parameters are set via `Twirs::with_*()` functions.
//!
//! Example:
//! ```ignore
//! Twirs::quads(pixels, radecs)
//!     .with_tolerance(0.5)
//!     .with_hash_tolerance(1.5);
//! ```
//!
//! After constructing the struct, there are two options:
//! - Directly calculate the least squares matrix between the 1-padded matrix of pixel and sky coordinates.
//! - Calculate the [`Wcs`](wcs::Wcs) transformation.
//!
//! Both can also be executed in parallel.
//!
//! ## Parameters
//! - `hash_tolerance`: Maximum allowed Euclidean distance between hashes.
//!     This is used in the nearest-neighbor search for matches between pixel and sky coordinates.
//! - `tolerance`: Maximum allowed Euclidean distance between points after applying the transformation.
//!     This is used in counting the number of matches to check which transformation is the best.
//! - `min_match`: Minimum number of matches between the pixel and sky coordinates after applying the transformation.
//!     If this number of matches is reached, the search for transformations is stopped.
//!     A lower number might lead to faster runtimes, but might also terminate the program before finding the optimal transformation.\
//!     **Warning: If using parallel execution (e.g. [`Twirs::find_transform_par()`]), this option is ignored.**\
//!
//! Only when using triangle asterisms:
//! - `min_angle`: Minimum angle of triangle asterisms.
//!     Triangles not fulfilling this condition are excluded from the transformation search.
